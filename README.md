## My process ðŸ¤”

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media query

### What I learned

This time around I was able to do things much faster, and I feel that I manage to organize my
code better. I could finally wrap my head around media query, which I've looked at it before but had not
used yet.
